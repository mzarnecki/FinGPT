# Financial Analysis Report: GameStop Corp.

## Income Statement Analysis (FY 2025)

GameStop has achieved a remarkable financial turnaround, reporting net income of $131.3 million in fiscal 2025, a substantial increase from $6.7 million in 2024. This represents a 3.4% net profit margin compared to just 0.1% in the previous year. The improvement comes despite a 27.5% decline in net sales to $3.82 billion, demonstrating effective cost management.

The company's gross profit margin improved significantly to 29.1% from 24.5%, reflecting a strategic shift toward higher-margin product categories. Collectibles now represent 18.8% of sales (up from 14.3%), while pre-owned hardware and accessories increased to 11.5% (from 9.3%).

Operating expenses were reduced by $193.5 million (14.6%), primarily through labor cost reductions, decreased consulting services, and reduced marketing expenses. However, SG&A as a percentage of sales increased to 29.6% from 25.1% due to the sales decline outpacing cost reductions.

The most significant contributor to profitability was interest income, which increased by $113.9 million to $163.4 million, driven by higher cash reserves from equity offerings and improved interest rates
