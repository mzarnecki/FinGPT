 Based on the income statement analysis, GameStop's revenue declined 27.5% year-over-year to $3.8 billion in fiscal 2024, with hardware, software and collectible sales all decreasing. However, the gross profit margin improved to 29.1% from 24.5% a year ago, indicating higher margins from collectibles and pre-owned products. Operating expenses fell but the operating margin remained slightly negative at -0.7% due to fixed costs. The net profit margin increased substantially to 3.4% from 0.1% previously, reflecting strong interest income growth. 

Overall, while top-line performance faces challenges, focus on cost optimization and higher-margin categories enhanced profitability. Continued cost controls and expansion into new growth areas can help power sustainable revenue and profit gains in the future if overall sales stabilize.
