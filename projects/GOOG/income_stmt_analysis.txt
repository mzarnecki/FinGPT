 The company generated $350 billion in total revenues for the current fiscal year, up 14% from the prior year. Revenues grew across key segments such as Google Search & Other, YouTube ads, and Google Cloud Platform. The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues improved to 42% versus 43% last year, as content acquisition costs and TAC ratio were managed well despite revenue mix shifts. However, R&D expenses increased moderately while G&A costs declined on lower legal charges, maintaining operating margins at 32%. Net income rose 36% to $100 billion, with the operating and net profit margins reaching new highs. Overall, the company demonstrated sustained double-digit topline expansion and improving cost efficiencies over the past year. Going forward, the company appears well-positioned to continue driving revenue growth through innovation and market expansion. However, tighter management of infrastructure investments and legal costs will be important to preserve margins as revenues scale further in the coming years.
