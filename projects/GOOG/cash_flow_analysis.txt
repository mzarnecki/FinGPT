 Alphabet generated $125.3 billion in operating cash flow in 2024, up 23% from 2023, indicating strong core business profitability. Cash from operations primarily came from advertising revenues, offset by payments for content, TAC, and operating expenses. 

Investing activities used $45.5 billion in cash, up from $27.1 billion, mainly due to a $20.3 billion increase in capital expenditures to $52.5 billion as the company continues investing heavily in infrastructure to support growth. Purchases of marketable securities also increased. 

Financing activities used $79.7 billion, up from $72.1 billion, as the company initiated a dividend program that paid out $7.4 billion and increased stock repurchases to $62.0 billion. Proceeds from debt issuance rose but were offset by repayments. 

Overall, Alphabet maintained robust liquidity with $95.7 billion in cash/investments at year-end despite increased investments and shareholder returns. Strong operating cash flow funds capital expenditures for sustainable long-term growth while dividend payments and buybacks indicate confidence in profitability. However, continued heavy infrastructure spending could strain liquidity if revenues slow. Alphabet's cash management has effectively balanced growth, returns, and liquidity thus far.
