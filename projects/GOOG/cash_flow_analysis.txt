 Alphabet generated $125.3 billion in operating cash flow in 2024, up 23% from 2023, indicating strong core business profitability. Cash outflows for investing rose 66% as capital expenditures increased to $52.5 billion primarily for infrastructure to support growth. Financing cash outflows increased 10% due to $7.4 billion in dividend payments and $62 billion for share repurchases, partially offset by debt issuance. Compared to prior periods, Alphabet's operating and investing cash flows have steadily increased, demonstrating sustainable growth. With $95.7 billion in cash/investments and $10 billion credit facilities as backup, Alphabet has ample liquidity to fund operations and $55.4 billion in commitments while returning cash to shareholders. Overall, Alphabet maintains effective cash management, and its liquidity position should enable further growth opportunities.
