# Financial Analysis Report: Tesla, Inc. (FY 2024)

## Executive Summary

Tesla's financial performance in 2024 demonstrates resilience amid market challenges, with total revenue reaching $97.69 billion, a modest 1% increase from $96.77 billion in 2023. Despite this minimal growth, the company maintained strong operational cash flow of $14.92 billion, up 12.6% year-over-year, reflecting effective working capital management. However, net income declined significantly to $7.13 billion from $15.00 billion in 2023, primarily due to the one-time tax benefit of $6.54 billion from valuation allowance release in 2023 that did not recur in 2024.
