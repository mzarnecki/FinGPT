 As of December 31, 2024, the company maintained a strong financial position with $36.56 billion in current assets, primarily cash and inventory, adequately covering $28.82 billion in current liabilities. Compared to prior years, liquidity improved as current assets grew faster than current obligations. Long-term debt of $10.36 billion was balanced against total equity of $73.68 billion, with debt comprising 12% of the capital structure. Solvency was solid, as evidenced by low debt ratios that fell within an acceptable range for the industry. Over time, the company has effectively managed growth while expanding capital through retained earnings and stock issuances. Prudent management of assets and liabilities, combined with an equity-focused capital structure, provide financial flexibility to fund operations and future projects. Overall, the balanced sheet demonstrates the company's continued fiscal health and ability to sustain long-term investments through all phases of development.
