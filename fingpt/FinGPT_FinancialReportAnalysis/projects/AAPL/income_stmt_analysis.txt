 Apple reported revenue of $391 billion for fiscal 2024, up slightly from last year. Gross margin improved to 46.2% on stable product costs and higher services revenue. Operating expenses grew modestly at 5%. Overall profitability remained strong, with net income of $94 billion and operating margin of 31%. While revenue growth has slowed, sustainable demand for replacement iPhones, robust services business, and rising average selling prices offset macro headwinds. Margins appear optimized for now, though continued innovation and procurement savings could further boost operating efficiency and profitability over time.
