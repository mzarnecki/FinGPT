 Tesla reported total revenues of $97.69B for 2024, up 1% YoY. Automotive gross margins declined to 18.4% from higher costs and lower average prices, while energy storage margins improved to 26.2% from cost reductions. Overall gross margin declined slightly to 17.9%. Operating expenses rose due to R&D investments, though net income fell 71% YoY due to prior-year tax benefits. While revenue growth has slowed, energy storage provides increasing profits alongside automotive. To further improve profitability, Tesla should focus on higher vehicle production volumes to spread costs, battery innovations to support affordable new models, and operational efficiencies as global factories mature.
