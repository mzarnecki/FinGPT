 Tesla's revenues grew 1% to $97.69 billion in 2024. Automotive revenues declined 6% due to lower average selling prices and product mix changes, though regulatory credit sales rose 54%. Energy storage sales significantly increased 67% with Megapack/Powerwall ramps. While gross margins fell in automotive due to higher costs for new products, energy storage margins improved to 26.2% from economies of scale. Operating margins remained stable as R&D expanded. Though net margins declined from the prior year's one-time tax benefit, automotive profitability and energy storage sales growth suggest ongoing revenue increases and margin optimization remain achievable through further efficiencies and new product development.
