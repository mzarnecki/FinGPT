 Tesla's operational cash flow remained strong, increased 17% despite lower profits. Heavy investment outlays expanded capacity rapidly. Debt issuance largely funded these, keeping liquidity stable near $37 billion. While fast growth stresses working capital and profit conversion, ongoing cash generation allows continuing investment. Overall, prudent cash management has sustained liquidity comfortably and positioned Tesla for ongoing substantial expansion, though macro pressures may challenge near-term results.
